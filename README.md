# Data-Feed 

Data-Feed is a real-time content aggregator built using [Angular](http://www.angularjs.org) and [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) using no back-end server. It contains a functional client and a service that parses RSS data and pushes it into Firebase. Data is then retreived from Firebase as needed depending on the user and the users settings. Authorization has been added using Firebase Login via Facebook, GitHub, your email and password, or set it up to be completely anonomous. Many other options are incorporated but not yet functional. 

## Collaboration

My name is Jason Romero and I have been using Angular for about 6 months now and absolutely love it. This is my first scaleable project and would like to see it through to full production. Anyone interested in giving their two cents, I would love to have it, so go ahead and show me what you got...
